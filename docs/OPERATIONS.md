# Windows, tunnel, and operator runbook

## Windows 11 standalone

1. Install Node.js 22 LTS and Git.
2. Run `install.bat` once. It performs clean installs, builds the frontend, and copies the immutable build into the backend serving directory.
3. Edit `backend\.env`. Generate three different random values for `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`, and `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
4. Run `npm run doctor`. Errors block startup; provider warnings mean the related feature is unavailable.
5. Run `start-sharet.bat`. Local access is `http://localhost:5005`.
6. Check `http://localhost:5005/ready`; a ready response confirms runtime validation and the database, not live Trello/SMTP acceptance.

Do not rebuild files while the server is serving them. Run `npm run build:serve`, then restart ShareT. HTML is revalidated and content-hashed assets are cached, preventing stale-manifest failures.

## Docker plus static ngrok domain

1. Copy `.env.docker.example` to `.env.docker` and fill every required value.
2. Set `NGROK_DOMAIN` to the hostname without `https://`; set `PUBLIC_URL`, `FRONTEND_URL`, and `CORS_ORIGIN` to its HTTPS URL.
3. Run `docker compose --env-file .env.docker config` and inspect the ngrok command without sharing the secret output.
4. Run `docker compose --env-file .env.docker up -d --build`.
5. Check `docker compose ps`, local `/ready`, public `/ready`, Trello OAuth, and webhook creation.

`redeploy.bat` automates the same Compose invocation. A changing temporary ngrok hostname is unsuitable because Trello callbacks, webhooks, existing links, and HAI's OpenAPI server URL depend on a stable origin.

The scheduled `watchdog.bat` must run from the same installed checkout and uses `docker compose --env-file .env.docker up -d`. It checks IPv4 `/ready`; do not point it at another checkout or an older Compose file, because Compose will reconcile the live container back to that stale configuration.

## HAI connection

1. Sign in to ShareT and open **HAI connector** in the profile.
2. Create read-only access. Copy the token once into HAI's protected environment as `HAI_SHARET_CONNECTOR_TOKEN`.
3. Set `HAI_SHARET_ENABLED=true`, set `HAI_SHARET_BASE_URL` to the displayed stable ShareT origin, and keep `HAI_SHARET_SYNC_LIMIT` above the complete link count (maximum 5,000).
4. Restart HAI and create its native `sharet` connected source with `localOnly=false` and an empty sync target.
5. Run a sync and confirm its item count matches ShareT's complete history. Revoke the credential in ShareT to verify the next sync fails closed, then issue the final credential.

HAI's native ShareT adapter is intentionally read-only. If a different reviewed API client must create or revoke links, issue a separate link-management credential and revoke it when no longer required.

## Backup, restore, and support

- Stop writes, then run `npm run backup` before upgrades or credential migrations.
- Verify the manifest and test `npm run restore -- <backup-directory> --confirm` only against a non-production copy first.
- `npm run support-bundle` gathers configuration state and health without copying secret environment files or raw database data.
- Set `MAINTENANCE_MODE=true` to block mutations during work.
- Set `SHARET_DISABLE_PUBLIC_ACCESS=true` to stop all public share routes immediately.

## Recovery order

1. Preserve `backend/data` and take a backup.
2. Run doctor and inspect `/ready`.
3. Check disk space and write access.
4. Check Trello/SMTP/tunnel credentials without printing values.
5. If only public access is unsafe, enable the public-access kill switch while owner diagnostics remain available.
6. Restore only after identifying corruption and keeping the previous data directory.
